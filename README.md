## About Me
I'm Ashley, a software engineer and graphic designer with a passion for fun and functional projects. When I'm not coding, I'm probably gaming or reading fantasy novels. I love coding, Thai food, sweet tea, and long walks on foreign beaches.

## My Dreams and Aspirations
One of my dreams is to be a software engineer full-time but own an alpaca farm someday with a little shop to sell their wool.

## Software Engineering: Bringing Ideas to Life
As a software engineer, my favorite part of the job is seeing all the hard work come to fruition on the screen. Turning ideas into functional and visually appealing applications is the best part! And yes, I even enjoy the process of debugging! It's not fun at the moment, but finding that problem that has been bugging you for hours is the best feeling.

## Ask Me About
Ask me about my favorite CSS font color (seashell), why I'm obsessed with Canva, or the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings. Let's talk about exactly the reason the eagles couldn't take the hobbits to Mordor.

## Get in Touch
I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers, designers, and anyone who shares similar interests. If you want to chat about software engineering, graphic design, or anything else under the sun, feel free to reach out! Let's create something awesome together.
